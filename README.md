### Why Python?

**Python is a great _general purpose_ language.**
* **Available** - Does not have many serious limitations; comes installed on most computers; can touch most disciplines.
* **Batteries Included** - Lots of built-in functions and classes, giving us lots of functionality to use upfront.
* **Beautiful** - Has minimal syntactic verbosity, such as needing to use brackets to chunk units of code.
* **Dynamic Typing** -- Does *not* require variables to be initialized before using them.
* **Strongly Typed** -- All variables are bound to the data type they are initialized as.
* **Interpreted** -- Does not require a language compiler, allowing it to be executed "on the fly" with a program (Python).


### More on Python...

**General Information**
* Created in 1991 by Guido Von Rossum
* High-level programming language - "high" meaning further from the kernal than "low" level program languages. (validate)
* Active Community & Development
  * Events, local groups, online courses, forums/chats, etc. and continual feature updates.


### Running Python Code

#### MacOS
* Run `python filename.py`

#### Windows
* Run `C:\Python\python.exe filename.py`

#### Jupyter
* Run `jupyter notebook`
* Goto `http://localhost:8888/tree`
* Click "New" -> "Python 3" **(or)** locate Python file in tree
