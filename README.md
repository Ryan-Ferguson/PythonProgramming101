### Why Python?

**Python is a great _general purpose_ language.**
* **Available** - Does not have many serious limitations; comes installed on most computers; can touch most disciplines.
* **Batteries Included** - Lots of built-in functions and classes, giving us lots of functionality to use upfront.
* **Beautiful** - Has minimal syntactic verbosity, such as needing to use brackets to chunk units of code.
* **Dynamic Typing** -- Does *not* require variables to be initialized before using them.
* **Strongly Typed** -- All variables are bound to the data type they are initialized as.
* **Interpreted** -- Does not require a language compiler, allowing it to be executed "on the fly" with a program (Python).


### More on Python...

**General Information**
* Created in 1991 by Guido Von Rossum
* High-level programming language - "high" meaning further from the kernal than "low" level program languages. (validate)
* Active Community & Development
  * Events, local groups, online courses, forums/chats, etc. and continual feature updates.


### Writing Python

When writing a program in Python -- or pretty much any language -- there are infinite programs which can be created. If an idea exists, there can be an improved version of it. This applies in the macro sense, in the context of a Product, to the micro sense of a single chunk of code.

Here are some things Developers will do in Python:

**Assignments:**

Assignments are made when a piece of abstract information, like a person's first name or age, needs to become computational data that Python can understand & manipulate. Information about me is below with different chunks of my "personal data" assigned to **variables** which are _references_ to our data.

```
name = "Ryan" # string
age = 28 # integer
hobbies = ["programming", "gaming", "writing", "reading"] # list, i.e. "array"
shoe_size = 10.5 # float, i.e. "decimal" or "floating point"
training = { # dictionary
 "informal": "Learning programming since 2012; self-taught",
 "formal": "MailChimp -- four years from Customer Support to Product then Ops"
}
```
